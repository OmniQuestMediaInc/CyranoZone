## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

Read this at the START of every new Claude Chat thread.
Read the handoff document AFTER this. Then proceed.

This document replaces the "paste six GitHub API URLs" ritual.
The handoff carries only: current PR state, QUEUE state, next action.
Everything else lives here and in the sibling REFERENCE_LIBRARY files.

## 2. REFERENCE LIBRARY INDEX

All structural files in `REFERENCE_LIBRARY/` on main.
Read via: `git show main:REFERENCE_LIBRARY/{filename}`
Or via GitHub contents API:
`https://api.github.com/repos/OmniQuestMediaInc/ChatNowZone--BUILD/contents/REFERENCE_LIBRARY/{filename}`

| File                     | Contents                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 00_THREAD_BOOTSTRAP.md   | This document — always read first             |
| 01_CANONICAL_LOCKS.md    | All CEO-locked invariants, tier rules, expiry |
| 02_DOMAIN_TAXONOMY.md    | All directive series, status, agent routing   |
| 03_FEATURE_BRIEFS.md     | FC, OPS, DISC, CCZ surface specifications     |
| 04_AI_REFERENCE_INDEX.md | AI resources mapped to directives             |
| 05_OSS_REPO_REGISTRY.md  | All 9 reference repos + branch access         |
| 06_PROJECT_DECISIONS.md  | Architecture decisions log                    |
| TEMPLATES/               | Reusable directive and workflow templates     |

## 2B. BUILDD CONTROL — GOOGLE DRIVE

Primary Drive folder for all CNZ control documents:
**BUILDD CONTROL - CNZ**
Folder ID: `1zB0MZjj92wovoBuhi0TkelZ_t0oNSCHO`
URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zB0MZjj92wovoBuhi0TkelZ_t0oNSCHO

What lives in Drive (not repo):

- Thread handoff documents (Google Docs — required for Claude Code delivery)
- QUEUE, IN_PROGRESS, DONE, BACKLOGS directive folders
- INTEL reports and OQMInc business documents
- OQMInc Templates folder (master templates)

What lives in REFERENCE_LIBRARY/ (not Drive):

- Canonical locks, taxonomy, feature briefs, AI index
- OSS repo registry, decisions log, thread bootstrap

Subfolder IDs (to be confirmed and populated at Thread 15 open):
| Subfolder | ID |
|-----------|-----|
| QUEUE | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |
| IN_PROGRESS | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |
| DONE | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |
| BACKLOGS | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |
| HANDOFFS | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |
| REPORT_BACK | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |
| OQMInc Templates | [CONFIRM AT THREAD 15] |

CRITICAL — Directive delivery to Claude Code:
Directives sent via Drive MUST be Google Docs (Zapier convert=true).
Plain text files return 403. Hard constraint — never plain text.
