## 0. PURPOSE

This document establishes the non-negotiable operational, security, and infrastructure policies for OmniQuest Media Inc. It governs server operations, database management, AI system usage, data security, backup/disaster-recovery (DR), and defenses against malware/ransomware.

It synthesizes the highest-integrity practices from:

- `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` (coding agents, AI advisory boundary, financial invariants, commit discipline, audit logging)
- Integration & Automation doctrine (deterministic, auditable, "It Just Works")
- REDBOOK Corpus & Canonical Corpus (financial sovereignty, compliance-first, consent/age-assurance, PII minimization)
- VoiceSampleCollectionService directive (encrypted path references only, never raw sensitive media in DB, consent gates)
- [INTEL] reporting and operational intelligence requirements

Where any conflict arises, this document and `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` prevail. This policy is Human-Review Category (§2.2 of `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`) for any material amendment.

---

## 1. REFERENCE TO CORE GOVERNANCE

All teams and agents must read and comply with `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` before any non-trivial infrastructure or security work. Key cross-references:

- §5 — Code invariants (append-only, deterministic, idempotent financial/audit paths)
- §6 — Security posture (least privilege, no secrets in code/logs, audit events with `rule_applied_id`)
- §7 — Advisory-AI boundary (AI is read-only/proposal-generating; never mutates ledger, authorizes refunds, or overrides compliance)
- §8 — Commit discipline (four-line FIZ format on financial-integrity paths)

---

## 2. CODING & AI INTEGRITY (EXTENDED FROM OQMI_GOVERNANCE)

Coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Grok, etc.) operate in **Droid Mode** only.

- No creative deviation from assigned tasks.
- All changes to financial, compliance, or PII-handling code require `rule_applied_id: 'VOICE_SAMPLE_v1'`-style traceability (or equivalent per module).

AI systems are **advisory infrastructure only**. They may draft policies, summarize logs, or propose code, but **never**:

- Compute earnings/payouts
- Mutate ledger/audit/balance tables
- Authorize irreversible actions (refunds, suspensions, content takedowns)
- Bypass consent/age gates

**Hard invariant:** Raw sensitive data (voice samples, ID images, payment details, NCII evidence) never enters application code or DB except via encrypted references or immutable audit hashes.

---

## 3. SERVER & DATABASE OPERATIONS

### Principles (zero-trust, defense-in-depth):

- All production workloads run in **Canada** (data sovereignty under PIPEDA).
- Database and cache services (Postgres, Redis, etc.) never exposed to public internet. Use private VPCs only.
- Least-privilege IAM / RBAC enforced at every layer (service accounts, not root).
- All traffic encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3 minimum).
- Encryption at rest mandatory (AWS KMS / equivalent with customer-managed keys where possible).
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced via `organization_id` + `tenant_id` on every write (per VoiceSample model pattern).

### Database invariants:

- Financial/audit/compliance tables: append-only (no `UPDATE`/`DELETE`; use offset entries).
- Every table includes `correlation_id`, `reason_code`, `rule_applied_id`.
- VoiceSample-style records store **encrypted path references only** (SSE-S3 object key); raw media/audio/PII never in DB.

## 4. CRITERIA FOR THIRD-PARTY CANADIAN SERVER PROVIDERS

All infrastructure vendors must meet or exceed the following mandatory criteria (evaluated annually by CEO + engineering lead):

| Criterion                   | Requirement                                                                                                                                                        | Rationale                                                             |

**Preferred Tier-1 providers (2026):** AWS ca-central-1, OVHcloud Canada, Azure Canada Central.

**Prohibited:** Any U.S.-only or non-sovereign providers for production workloads.

---

## 5. BACKUP & DISASTER-RECOVERY PLANS

**Mandatory 3-2-1 Rule (with immutability):**

- 3 copies of data
- 2 different media/types (e.g., S3 + Glacier)
- 1 offsite / air-gapped (immutable object storage or tape)

### Specific requirements:

- Daily immutable backups (S3 Object Lock or equivalent with 90-day minimum retention for financial/audit data).
- Weekly full + daily incremental for non-financial data.
- Encrypted (AES-256) and immutable (WORM — Write Once, Read Many).
- Tested quarterly (documented restore drills with RTO/RPO metrics).
- Voice samples & PII: Backups reference encrypted S3 keys only; never contain raw media.
- **RPO:** ≤5 minutes for financial/audit data; ≤1 hour for all other production data.
- **RTO:** ≤15 minutes for critical services (ledger, consent gates).
- **DR Strategy:** Active-active in secondary Canadian AZ/region where feasible. Failover tested biannually.

---

## 6. DATA SECURITY & PII HANDLING

- **Classification:** All data tagged (Public / Internal / Sensitive / Restricted). Voice samples, consent logs, payment events = Restricted.
- **Minimization:** Store only what is required. Raw audio/ID images never persisted.
- **Encryption:** At-rest (KMS), in-transit (TLS 1.3), in-use where possible (confidential computing).
- **Access:** Just-in-time, audited, role-bound, step-up authentication for Restricted data.
- **Logging:** Every access to Restricted data emits immutable audit event (§6.5 of `OQMI_GOVERNANCE`).
- **Deletion/Retention:** Strict legal holds for compliance data; automated purge after retention window (PIPEDA-aligned).

---

## 7. MALWARE & RANSOMWARE DEFENSE

### Defense-in-depth stack (mandatory):

- Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) on all servers/workstations.
- Network segmentation (micro-segmentation via VPCs/security groups).
- Immutable backups (see §5) — primary ransomware mitigation.
- Zero-trust network access (no direct SSH/RDP; use bastion or SSM).
- MFA everywhere (including infrastructure consoles and CI/CD).
- Continuous vulnerability scanning + automated patching (within 48h for critical CVEs).
- Air-gapped / offline backups for long-term archives.

### Incident Response Plan (IRP):

1. Immediate isolation of affected systems.
2. Forensic snapshot before remediation.
3. CEO notification within 15 minutes.
4. Post-incident [INTEL] report filed within 24h.
5. Lessons-learned incorporated into policy within 7 days.

**Prohibited:** Any "restore from backup" that would re-introduce malware. Always validate integrity first.

---

## 8. MONITORING, ALERTING & [INTEL] REPORTING

- Centralized observability (logs, metrics, traces) with immutable retention.
- Automated anomaly detection for financial drift, consent-gate bypass, unusual access patterns.
- All incidents generate "evidence-ready" [INTEL] pack per attached [INTEL] Report Requirements.
- Monthly executive security posture review (CEO + engineering).

---

## 9. AGENT & VENDOR HANDOFF PROTOCOL

Same discipline as `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §9`. Any incomplete infrastructure work must end with a `## HANDOFF` block specifying next steps.

---

## 10. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE

Follow Human-Review Category process in `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §2.2`. PR modifying this document requires CEO merge.

---

## 11. INVARIANTS REGISTER (QUICK REFERENCE)

1. **Canada-only data residency** for production.
2. **Raw sensitive media/PII never stored in DB** — encrypted references only.
3. **Immutable, encrypted, tested backups** (3-2-1 + WORM).
4. **AI advisory-only**; never mutates financial/compliance state.
5. **All infrastructure changes audited** with `rule_applied_id`.
6. **Least-privilege + zero-trust** enforced at every layer.
7. **Ransomware defense** = immutable backups + rapid isolation.

---

This policy is effective immediately. All existing and future infrastructure must conform.

**Authority:** Kevin B. Hartley, CEO — OmniQuest Media Inc.
**Effective:** 2026-05-06
