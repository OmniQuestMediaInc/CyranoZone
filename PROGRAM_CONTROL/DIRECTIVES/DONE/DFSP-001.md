## Objective

Implement DFSP Modules 3 and 4. These modules are tightly coupled —
Module 4 auto-triggers on Module 3 failure threshold.

- **Module 3 — PlatformOtpService**
  `services/core-api/src/dfsp/platform-otp.service.ts` (CREATE)
  Platform-native dual-channel OTP for Diamond/VIP step-up auth.

- **Module 4 — AccountRecoveryHoldService**
  `services/core-api/src/dfsp/account-recovery-hold.service.ts` (CREATE)
  48-hour security hold triggered by contact-info swap attacks or
  5 consecutive OTP failures during a high-value transaction.

---

## Gate Status

PROC-001 prerequisite: ✅ SATISFIED — merged to main as `0aa416c` PR#190

- No controller/ledger coupling landed with PROC-001
- Gate constraints preserved through merge

GOV-FINTRAC: ✅ CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED — 2026-04-11
GOV-AGCO: ✅ CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED — 2026-04-11

Both gates cleared via PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED-2026-04-11.md.
DFSP-001 may proceed.

## Scope

### Files to Create

services/core-api/src/dfsp/platform-otp.service.ts
services/core-api/src/dfsp/account-recovery-hold.service.ts

### Files to Modify

- `services/core-api/src/dfsp/dfsp.module.ts`
  — import and register both new services
- `services/core-api/src/governance/governance.config.ts`
  — add constants listed below if not already present

### Files to Confirm Unchanged

- `prisma/schema.prisma` — NO changes. OtpEvent + AccountHold models
  already exist from PV-001. Do not create migrations.
- `services/nats/topics.registry.ts` — NO changes. All required NATS
  topics already added in PR#192. Use existing constants only.

---

## Prisma Models — Confirmed from PV-001 (READ ONLY)

**OtpEvent** (line 391 in schema.prisma):
id, account_id, transaction_id, code_hash, channel,
issued_at, expires_at, used_at, failed_attempts, status,
organization_id, tenant_id

- `code_hash` — String column; bcrypt output fits with no schema change
- `failed_attempts` — ready for 5-consecutive-failure counter
- Multi-tenant enforced ✅

**AccountHold** (line 408 in schema.prisma):
id, account_id, trigger_type, trigger_transaction_id,
triggered_at, hold_until, released_at, released_by,
release_reason, identity_reverified,
organization_id, tenant_id

- `trigger_type` — String enum values at service level:
  "contact_change" | "otp_5_fail" | "agent_flag"
- `identity_reverified` — present for Module 4 release gate ✅
- Multi-tenant enforced ✅

**DO NOT fabricate new migrations. Schema is complete.**

---

## GovernanceConfig Constants Required

Confirm these exist. Add any that are absent — additive only:
DFSP_OTP_TTL_SECONDS — already present (900 = 15 min) ✅
DFSP_OTP_BCRYPT_COST — ADD IF ABSENT: default 12
DFSP_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS — ADD IF ABSENT: default 5
DFSP_ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOLD_HOURS — already present (48) ✅

---

## NATS Topics — All Pre-registered on Main (PR#192)

Use these exact constant names. Do not use string literals.

```typescript
NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_ISSUED;
NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_VERIFIED;
NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_FAILED;
NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_EXPIRED;
NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_APPLIED;
NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_RELEASED;
```

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Module 3 — PlatformOtpService

**OTP Alphabet:**

```typescript
const ALPHABET = 'ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789'; // 32 chars
// Excluded: O, 0, I, 1, L — ambiguous characters
```

32 characters gives clean power-of-two indexing.
Adjust to 30-char if spec requires exactly — document choice in code.

**OTP Generation:**

- Use `crypto.randomInt(0, ALPHABET.length)` to index into alphabet
- 7 characters total
- Format for display: XXXXXX-Y (hyphen after char 6 — display only)
- Store as 7-char string without hyphen before hashing
- Hash with bcrypt at cost `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_BCRYPT_COST`
- Store hash in `OtpEvent.code_hash` — never store plaintext
- Set `expires_at` = now + `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_TTL_SECONDS`
- Set `failed_attempts` = 0 on creation
- Emit `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_ISSUED` on every generation

**Invariant #4 note:** `crypto.randomInt()` satisfies Invariant #4
and is the correct primitive here. Do not use `crypto.randomBytes()`.

**Invariant #13 carve-out:** `OtpEvent.code_hash` uses bcrypt
(cost from `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_BCRYPT_COST`) per DFSP
Engineering Spec v1.0 Module 3. Bcrypt is required here because
SHA-256 is GPU-brute-forceable against a constrained OTP space on
DB breach. Invariant #13 SHA-256 requirement continues to apply to
all other hash operations in this and all other services.

**OTP Verification:**

- Hash inbound candidate with bcrypt.compare() against stored hash
- Check expiry: `expires_at` < now → EXPIRED
- Check status: already consumed → ALREADY_CONSUMED
- Check failed_attempts: ≥ `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
  → INVALID (locked)
- On failure: increment `failed_attempts` on OtpEvent record
- On success: set `used_at` = now, set status = CONSUMED (append-
  pattern — write new state, do not UPDATE existing row if schema
  supports append; if OtpEvent uses UPDATE for status, this is the
  documented exception per PV-001 schema design)
- Emit appropriate NATS topic on every outcome
- Every result object must include `rule_applied_id`

**Verification result codes:**
VERIFIED | INVALID | EXPIRED | ALREADY_CONSUMED

**Delivery channels (stub — email provider is V6 infra):**
email_primary | email_secondary | sms_secondary
Log channel on OtpEvent. Do not implement actual delivery — stub only.

---

### Module 4 — AccountRecoveryHoldService

**Trigger conditions:**

- Contact-information change attempt during active Diamond transaction
- 5 consecutive OTP failures for a given account_id
- Agent flag

**Module 3 → Module 4 coupling:**

- AccountRecoveryHoldService subscribes to `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_OTP_FAILED`
- On receipt: check `OtpEvent.failed_attempts` for the account_id
- Trigger threshold: `failed_attempts` ≥ `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
- Failure counter window: counter resets on `DFSP_OTP_VERIFIED` event
  OR on OTP TTL expiry — whichever comes first
- Do not trigger if an active hold already exists for the account

**Hold placement (append-only):**

- Write new AccountHold record
- Set `triggered_at` = now (America/Toronto)
- Set `hold_until` = now + `GovernanceConfig.DFSP_ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOLD_HOURS`
- Set `trigger_type` per trigger condition
- Set `organization_id` + `tenant_id` — mandatory
- Emit `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_APPLIED`
- Result object includes `rule_applied_id`

**During hold — service must enforce:**
purchases: BLOCKED
gifting: BLOCKED
withdrawals: BLOCKED
login: PERMITTED (read-only)
settings changes: BLOCKED
active transaction on trigger: CANCELLED

**Hold release requirements (all three must be satisfied):**

1. `identity_reverified` = true
2. `hold_until` elapsed
3. Agent sign-off

**CEO approval required** to shorten hold below 48 hours.
Do not implement a shortening path — note it as a deferred
directive requiring CEO authorization at execution time.

**Hold release (append-only):**

- Write release record — do not UPDATE original hold row
- Set `released_at` = now (America/Toronto)
- Set `released_by`, `release_reason`, `identity_reverified`
- Emit `NATS_TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD_RELEASED`
- Result object includes `rule_applied_id`

**Result codes:**
HOLD_PLACED | HOLD_RELEASED | HOLD_NOT_FOUND |
ALREADY_HELD | RELEASE_CONDITIONS_NOT_MET

## Invariant Checklist (all 15)

Before committing, Claude Code must verify:

- [ ] 1. No UPDATE/DELETE on ledger/audit/game/call/voucher tables —
     OtpEvent status update is the documented exception per PV-001
     schema; all other tables strictly append-only
- [ ] 2. FIZ four-line commit format — REASON/IMPACT/CORRELATION_ID/GATE
- [ ] 3. No hardcoded constants — all values from GovernanceConfig
- [ ] 4. crypto.randomInt() used for OTP generation — Math.random()
     prohibited — crypto.randomBytes() also prohibited here
- [ ] 5. No @angular/core imports
- [ ] 6. npx tsc --noEmit zero new errors before commit
- [ ] 7. Logger instance on every service
- [ ] 8. Report-back filed before DONE

     NATS*TOPICS.DFSP_ACCOUNT_HOLD*_ only — no string literals
- [ ] 10. AI services advisory only — no financial execution
      (N/A — these are infrastructure services)
- [ ] 11. Step-up auth boundary — OTP service generates/verifies only;
      does not itself authorize financial actions
- [ ] 12. RBAC check confirmed upstream before OTP is issued
- [ ] 13. SHA-256 for all hash operations EXCEPT OtpEvent.code_hash
      which uses bcrypt per documented carve-out above
- [ ] 14. All timestamps in America/Toronto
- [ ] 15. rule_applied_id on every output object:
      'PLATFORM_OTP_v1' and 'ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_HOLD_v1'

**Multi-tenant mandate (LOCKED v1.1a):**

- [ ] organization_id + tenant_id on all Prisma writes ✅

**Schema integrity:**

- [ ] No new Prisma models created
- [ ] No migrations generated or run
- [ ] OtpEvent + AccountHold confirmed from PV-001 — read-only
