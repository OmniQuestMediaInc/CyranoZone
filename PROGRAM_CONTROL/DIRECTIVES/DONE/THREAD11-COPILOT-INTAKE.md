Rule: GOV-CONST-001-PATCH

Create PR targeting main. Merge it.
Report back with commit hash and tsc --noEmit confirmation.
When merged, immediately begin DIRECTIVE 2 below.

# ================================================================

# DIRECTIVE 2 — MEMB-001

# Agent: CLAUDE_CODE | Branch: fiz/memb-001

# Begin only after DIRECTIVE 1 PR is merged to main.

# ================================================================

Context: No server-side zone access enforcement exists. Every protected
endpoint is open. Highest-priority product-surface gap blocking launch.

TASK 1 — Create ZoneAccessService
Path: services/core-api/src/zone-access/zone-access.service.ts

- On every protected endpoint call, resolve the requesting user's
  current membership tier (DAY_PASS / ANNUAL / OMNIPASS_PLUS /
  DIAMOND) plus any active ShowZonePass records
- Check resolved access against ZONE_MAP in GovernanceConfig
- Return: GRANTED or DENIED with reason_code and rule_applied_id
- Log every decision via Logger (both GRANTED and DENIED)
- Throw 403 ForbiddenException with structured payload on DENIED
- No hardcoded tier or zone values — GovernanceConfig only

TASK 2 — Add ZONE_MAP to GovernanceConfig
File: services/core-api/src/config/governance.config.ts
Add ZONE_MAP block. Canonical zone keys:
CHAT_ZONE, SHOW_THEATRE, BIJOU, PRIVATE_CALL, DIAMOND_CONCIERGE
Canonical tiers: DAY_PASS, ANNUAL, OMNIPASS_PLUS, DIAMOND
ShowZonePass overrides tier gate for SHOW_THEATRE and BIJOU.

TASK 3 — Create ZoneAccessGuard
Implement CanActivate. Apply to all zone-gated route controllers.
Guard calls ZoneAccessService and blocks on DENIED.

TASK 4 — NATS topic
File: services/nats/topics.registry.ts
Register: zone.access.denied → ZONE_ACCESS_DENIED
Publish on every DENIED decision with user_id, zone, reason_code,
rule_applied_id, timestamp (America/Toronto).

TASK 5 — Prisma
Confirm or add ShowZonePass model.
Required fields: id, user_id, zone (enum), valid_from, valid_until,
organization_id, tenant_id, created_at.
Run prisma generate (schema only, no migration).

Invariant checks:

- No hardcoded zone or tier strings — enums and GovernanceConfig only
- rule_applied_id on every access decision output
- organization_id + tenant_id on all Prisma writes
- Logger on ZoneAccessService and ZoneAccessGuard
- npx tsc --noEmit zero new errors
- NATS_TOPICS.\* constants only — no raw strings

Commit message (FIZ four-line):
FIZ: Add ZoneAccessService + Guard — server-side zone enforcement

- ZoneAccessService: resolves tier + ShowZonePass, checks ZoneMap
- ZoneAccessGuard: applied to all protected zone endpoints
- ZONE_MAP in GovernanceConfig; ZONE_ACCESS_DENIED NATS topic
- Zero new tsc errors

Rule: MEMB-001

Create PR targeting main. Report back with commit hash, list of
controllers ZoneAccessGuard was applied to, ShowZonePass schema
confirmation, and tsc --noEmit confirmation.
When merged, immediately begin DIRECTIVE 3.

# ================================================================

# DIRECTIVE 3 — MEMB-002

# Agent: CLAUDE_CODE | Branch: fiz/memb-002

# Begin only after DIRECTIVE 2 PR is merged to main.

# ================================================================

Context: ZoneAccessService (MEMB-001) has no durable tier record to
resolve against. This directive builds membership persistence and
the billing foundation.

TASK 1 — MembershipSubscription model (Prisma)
Add to prisma/schema.prisma:
Fields: id, user_id, tier (enum: DAY_PASS / ANNUAL /
OMNIPASS_PLUS / DIAMOND), status (ACTIVE / CANCELLED / EXPIRED /
GRACE), billing_interval (MONTHLY / QUARTERLY / SEMI_ANNUAL /
ANNUAL), commitment_months (Int), bonus_months (Int, default 0),
current_period_start, current_period_end, cancelled_at (nullable),
organization_id, tenant_id, created_at, updated_at.
Add unique constraint: one ACTIVE subscription per user.
Run prisma generate (schema only, no migration).

TASK 2 — MembershipService
Path: services/core-api/src/membership/membership.service.ts
Methods:

- getActiveTier(userId): resolves tier from MembershipSubscription;
  returns DAY_PASS if no active subscription found
- createSubscription(userId, tier, billingInterval): creates record,
  calculates bonus_months per ADR-003:
  QUARTERLY = 3+1, SEMI_ANNUAL = 6+2, ANNUAL = 12+3
  sets period start/end dates
- cancelSubscription(userId): sets CANCELLED, retains access
  until current_period_end
- expireSubscription(subscriptionId): sets EXPIRED, tier resolves
  to DAY_PASS on next getActiveTier call
  Logger on every method. rule_applied_id on every state change.

TASK 3 — Wire ZoneAccessService to MembershipService
Replace any stub tier resolution in ZoneAccessService with
MembershipService.getActiveTier(). No other ZoneAccessService changes.

TASK 4 — Duration bonus matrix in GovernanceConfig
File: services/core-api/src/config/governance.config.ts
Add MEMBERSHIP.DURATION_BONUS block:
QUARTERLY: { commitment_months: 3, bonus_months: 1 }
SEMI_ANNUAL: { commitment_months: 6, bonus_months: 2 }
ANNUAL: { commitment_months: 12, bonus_months: 3 }

TASK 5 — NATS topics
Register in services/nats/topics.registry.ts:
membership.subscription.created → MEMBERSHIP_SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED
membership.subscription.cancelled → MEMBERSHIP_SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELLED
membership.subscription.expired → MEMBERSHIP_SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRED
Publish on each corresponding MembershipService state change.

Invariant checks:

- One ACTIVE subscription per user enforced at DB level
- No hardcoded tier or interval values — GovernanceConfig and enums only
- organization_id + tenant_id on all Prisma writes
- Logger + rule_applied_id on all methods
- npx tsc --noEmit zero new errors

Commit message (FIZ four-line):
FIZ: Add MembershipSubscription model + MembershipService

- MembershipSubscription schema: tier, billing, bonus_months
- MembershipService: getActiveTier / create / cancel / expire
- Duration bonus matrix in GovernanceConfig (ADR-003)
- ZoneAccessService wired to MembershipService.getActiveTier

Rule: MEMB-002

Create PR targeting main. Report back with commit hash, schema diff
summary, tsc confirmation. When merged, immediately begin DIRECTIVE 4.

# ================================================================

# DIRECTIVE 4 — MEMB-003

# Agent: CLAUDE_CODE | Branch: fiz/memb-003

# Begin only after DIRECTIVE 3 PR is merged to main.

# ================================================================

Context: Membership tiers carry monthly CZT stipends. No stipend
distribution job exists.

TASK 1 — Stipend amounts in GovernanceConfig
File: services/core-api/src/config/governance.config.ts
Add MEMBERSHIP.STIPEND_CZT block:
DAY_PASS: 0
ANNUAL: 100
OMNIPASS_PLUS: 250
DIAMOND: 500
Values are CZT units. Revisable via GOV: commit only.

TASK 2 — StipendDistributionJob
Path: services/core-api/src/membership/stipend-distribution.job.ts

- Scheduled: first day of each billing month per subscription
  current_period_start
- For each ACTIVE subscription where STIPEND_CZT[tier] > 0:
  - Call LedgerService.recordEntry with:
    amount: STIPEND_CZT[tier]
    token_origin: TokenOrigin.GIFTED
    reason_code: 'MONTHLY_STIPEND'
    rule_applied_id: populated
    idempotency_key: subscription_id + billing_period_start (ISO)
    organization_id, tenant_id: from subscription
  - Publish NATS: membership.stipend.distributed
- On LedgerService error: log and continue; do not halt batch
- Logger on job start, each grant, each error, job complete

TASK 3 — Idempotency
Confirm LedgerService supports idempotency_key on recordEntry.
If not present, add the field and unique DB constraint in this
directive. Duplicate key must be rejected — no double-grant.

TASK 4 — NATS topic
Register: membership.stipend.distributed → MEMBERSHIP_STIPEND_DISTRIBUTED

Invariant checks:

- Append-only ledger — no UPDATE on ledger rows
- token_origin: GIFTED on all stipend entries
- idempotency_key prevents double-grant
- rule_applied_id on every ledger entry
- organization_id + tenant_id on all Prisma writes
- npx tsc --noEmit zero new errors

Commit message (FIZ four-line):
FIZ: Add StipendDistributionJob — monthly CZT grant per tier

- StipendDistributionJob: scheduled, idempotent, GIFTED origin
- MEMBERSHIP.STIPEND_CZT constants in GovernanceConfig
- MEMBERSHIP_STIPEND_DISTRIBUTED NATS topic registered
- LedgerService idempotency_key confirmed or added

Rule: MEMB-003

# Agent: CLAUDE_CODE | Branch: bijou/bj-003

# Begin only after DIRECTIVE 5 PR is merged to main.

# ================================================================

Context: Bijou Admission queue. Guests request entry; the queue manages
the 10-second accept window, standby, 30-second camera grace, and
ejection. Depends on BijouSession from BJ-002.

TASK 1 — BijouAdmission model (Prisma)
Fields: id, session_id, user_id, status (PENDING / ADMITTED /
STANDBY / EJECTED / ABANDONED), admitted_at (nullable),

  - CREATOR_AUTO = true: apply Bill 149 (ON) disclosure prefix
    from GovernanceConfig OBS.BILL_149_DISCLOSURE_PREFIX to any
    generated response before publishing
- Rule-based pass only in this directive — no AI call (OBS-004)
- Publish NATS: persona.response.queued when response generated
- rule_applied_id required on every persona.response.queued event
- Logger on all decisions

TASK 5 — GovernanceConfig OBS block
File: services/core-api/src/config/governance.config.ts
