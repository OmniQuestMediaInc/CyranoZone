# OQMI SYSTEM STATE

**Document:** OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md
**Repo:** OmniQuestMediaInc/ChatNowZone--BUILD
**Version:** v1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-23
**Owner:** Kevin B. Hartley, CEO — OmniQuest Media Inc.
**Governing Document:** `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`

## 0. PURPOSE

This document is the living tech-debt and accomplishment tracker for this repository. It answers, at any point in time, three questions:

1. **DONE** — What has been built and is in production or merged to `main`?
2. **WIP** — What is actively in progress, on which branch, by which agent?
3. **OUTSTANDING** — What remains to be built, in what priority order, with what blockers?

It is NOT a doctrine document. Doctrine lives in `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` (generic, repo-portable) and, where applicable, in this repo's product Canonical Corpus.

This document is rescoped from prior versions which carried doctrine inline. Doctrine has been moved to `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`. This file now tracks state only.

This document is repo-specific in content and repo-portable in shape. Drop the structure into any OmniQuest Media Inc. repo and populate.

## 3. DONE — Shipped to `main`

Reverse-chronological list of completed work. Each entry one row. Pruning policy: items older than 90 days may be archived to `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE_ARCHIVE.md` to keep this file scannable.

| Date       | Item                                                                                         | PR / Commit                                                                                       | Agent       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 4. WIP — In Progress

Active work. Update when started, when blocked, and when completed (move to §3). One row per branch.

| Branch | Item | Started | Agent | Blocker | Next Action |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ----------- |

If a WIP item has been static for >7 days without a blocker, that itself is a flag — surface in §6.

---

## 5. OUTSTANDING — Backlog

Prioritized list of work not yet started. Top of the list is the next thing to work on. CEO sets priority order; agents do not reorder without instruction.

| Priority | Item                                | Source                       | Estimated Scope | Blocker                      | Notes |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| 1        | [Highest priority outstanding work] | [e.g., Deficit doc row R-12] | [S/M/L/XL]      | [none / what's needed first] |       |
| 2        | [Next item]                         | [Source]                     |                 |                              |       |
| 3        | [...]                               |                              |                 |                              |       |

Source values:

- `Deficit doc row [ID]` — derived from technical deficit document
- `Canonical Corpus §[N]` — derived from product Canonical Corpus requirement
- `Business plan §[N]` — derived from business plan technical requirement
- `Bug` — defect found in shipped code
- `CEO directive YYYY-MM-DD` — direct CEO instruction
- `Tech debt` — internal cleanup not driven by external requirement

Scope values: `S` (<1 day), `M` (1–3 days), `L` (3–10 days), `XL` (>10 days, should be decomposed)

---

## 6. BLOCKERS & FLAGS

Active blockers, stalled work, and items requiring CEO attention. Each entry should resolve to either a CEO decision, an external action, or a re-assignment.

| Date Flagged | Item                                                        | Type                | Owner          | What's Needed             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| YYYY-MM-DD   | [e.g., HeartZone scope unclear vs HeartPleasureExperiences] | CEO clarification   | claude-in-chat | Naming and scope decision |
| YYYY-MM-DD   | [e.g., Vendor X integration broken]                         | External dependency | copilot        | Vendor support response   |

Type values: `CEO clarification`, `External dependency`, `Tooling`, `Credential`, `Architecture decision`, `Other`

---

## 7. RETIRED ITEMS

Things that were in this repo, have been removed, and should not be reintroduced. Recorded so future agents do not accidentally rebuild retired work.

| Date Retired | Item                                                              | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 8. PROVENANCE NOTES

Anything an incoming agent needs to know that doesn't fit elsewhere: terminology that has shifted, files that look authoritative but aren't, branches that look active but are dead, peculiarities of this repo's history.

- `/tests/seed_data/` is the authoritative source for Ghost Alpha simulations. (Preserved from root `README.md` prior to A003 deletion; landed by CNZ-WORK-001-A004 on 2026-04-22.)
- `Sovereign_Kernel.md.pdf` is RETIRED — moved to `archive/governance/Sovereign_Kernel.md.pdf` on 2026-04-23 (CNZ-WORK-001-A005). Do not treat as authoritative.
- Root-level `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` (OQMI CODING DOCTRINE v2.0, March 28, 2026) is RETIRED — deleted on 2026-04-23 (CNZ-WORK-001-A006). Superseded by this file (PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md) and by OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md.
- Root-level `README.md` deleted on 2026-04-23 (CNZ-WORK-001-A003); its only fact (Ghost Alpha provenance) was preserved by A004 above.
- Commit prefix enum: the canonical list lives in `docs/DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md` under "COMMIT PREFIX ENUM — CANONICAL" (landed 2026-04-23 by CNZ-WORK-001-A012). The old OQMI v2.0 enum and the RRR-GOV-002 §3.5 enum are retired — consult only the glossary.
- `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` was found truncated at §8 on 2026-04-23 (§§9–§12 missing though referenced elsewhere). Flagged in A012 REPORT_BACK for a future governance-scoped restore.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` carries large stretches of "OQMI CODING DOCTRINE v2.0" text duplicating content now in OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md and superseded prefix conventions. Header pointer fixed 2026-04-23 (A005/A006); broader doctrine refresh of that file is a follow-up.

## 9. THIS DOCUMENT'S OWN STATE

| Field                | Value                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Last full review     | 2026-04-23                                        |
| Reviewed by          | claude-code (CNZ-WORK-001-A012 + A014 pass)       |
| Stale-flag threshold | 30 days since last update triggers automatic flag |

If this document has not been updated in 30 days but the repo has commits in that window, the document is out of date and the next agent to touch the repo should reconcile it before doing other work.

## 10. UPDATE PROTOCOL

Any agent that completes, starts, blocks, retires, or reprioritizes work in this repo MUST update this document in the same PR as the work itself. Updating this file is not Human-Review Category — it auto-merges with the work it documents.

Format discipline:

- Add new rows; do not delete historical ones except via §3 archive policy or §7 retirement
- Use ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Use the status enums declared in §2 and source enums declared in §5
- One item per row; if an item has multiple sub-items, decompose into multiple rows or link out to an issue tracker

Failure to update this document on relevant PRs is a §4.4 violation under `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`.
