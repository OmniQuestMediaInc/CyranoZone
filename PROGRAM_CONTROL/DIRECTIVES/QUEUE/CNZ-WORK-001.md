**Governing documents:**

- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` — governance, RoE, invariants
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` — DONE/WIP/OUTSTANDING tracker

**Source of tasks:**

- `docs/ASSESSMENTS/REPO_VS_PLAN_TECHNICAL_DEFICIT_v1.md` (Thread 18, 36 rows)
- Thread 18 → Thread 19 handoff
- CEO directives 2026-04-21
- Tech-debt findings from Thread 19 repo scan (2026-04-21)

## 0. PERSISTENCE & LIFECYCLE — READ FIRST

This file is NOT a normal directive. It does not move to DONE/ when individual tasks complete.

The charter file (this document) is persistent. It lives at `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/CNZ-WORK-001.md` indefinitely.

**Tasks are individually trackable.** Each task has a stable ID (`CNZ-WORK-001-A001`, `CNZ-WORK-001-A002`, …). When a task merges:

1. A completion record is written to `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/DONE/CNZ-WORK-001-<task-id>-DONE.md` using the template in §11.
1. The task’s `Status:` line in §6 is amended in-place from `QUEUED` → `DONE` and the merge commit SHA + DONE filename are appended.
1. The corresponding row in `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` §3 DONE / §5 OUTSTANDING is updated in the same PR per OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §4.4.

**The charter is amended, not replaced.** New tasks may be appended to the active Wave by the CEO. Closed tasks are never deleted from the charter — they remain as history.

**The charter only retires when the CEO explicitly authors a successor charter** (e.g. CNZ-WORK-002) and marks this one RETIRED. At that point it moves to `archive/charters/`.

This file contains NO governance, NO RoE, NO invariants. Those live in `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`. This file lists work.

---

## 1. SCOPE

This charter covers all architecture and coding work required to close the tech-debt deficit identified in Thread 18 and bring ChatNowZone–BUILD to the 1 October 2026 hard launch ship gate.

Scope is bounded to:

- ChatNowZone–BUILD repository
- Code, schema, infra, docs, governance-adjacent cleanup within the repo
- Plan-amendment tasks (R-P0-\* documentation amendments to v2.8 business plan) that originate from the repo-vs-plan deficit assessment

**Out of scope:**

- Changes to other OmniQuest Media Inc. repos (RedRoomRewards, OmniQuest Media Inc. corporate site, etc.)
- Business plan content beyond the eight R-P0 amendments listed
- Marketing, creator onboarding, Telegram strategy (those have separate workstreams)

---

## 2. AGENT ROUTING

Each task carries an `Agent:` hint:

- `copilot` — preferred for repo chores, file moves, config edits, multi-file mechanical work
- `claude-code` — preferred for service authoring, schema design, complex refactors, anything FIZ-scoped
- `either` — task is small and routing-agnostic; first-come-first-served

The hint is a **routing suggestion, not an exclusivity lock.** An agent that cannot satisfy a task’s `Agent:` hint may still execute it if no other agent has claimed it within 24h, but must note the override in the report-back.

All agents operate under OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §1 (assignment-equals-approval) and §4.2 (Droid Mode default). HARD_STOP on any ambiguity, missing dependency, missing operator decision, or invariant conflict.

---

## 3. WAVE STRUCTURE & CADENCE

Tasks are grouped into Waves. Waves execute roughly sequentially but tasks within a Wave may run in parallel where dependencies permit.

- **Wave A — Repo Hygiene & Pre-Read** (must complete before Wave B opens)
- **Wave B — CEO Decision Surfacing** (parallel to Wave A; surfaces clarifies)
- **Wave C — Plan Amendments** (R-P0-\* documentation; parallel to anything)
- **Wave D — Verification & Extension of L0 Spine** (the eight existing services)
- **Wave E — Net-New L0 Build** (P0 stack assets not yet in repo)
- **Wave F — Plan IP Layer** (P1 stack assets, clarify-blocked)
- **Wave G — XL Decomposition Outputs** (Cyrano layers, Black-Glass decomposed pieces)
- **Wave H — Hardening & Pre-Launch Cleanup**

Each Wave terminates in a `CNZ-WORK-001-CHORE-<wave>` cleanup task. The next Wave does not open until the cleanup task is DONE.

---

## 4. PRIORITY MODEL

- **P0** — Launch-blocking; must be done before 1 October 2026
- **P1** — Required for full v2.8 plan delivery; not strictly launch-blocking
- **P2** — Quality/governance hardening; can ship without
- **P3** — Nice-to-have, future roadmap

Within Waves, P0 > P1 > P2 > P3.

---

## 5. STATUS ENUMS

- `QUEUED` — task in backlog, not yet started
- `CLAIMED` — agent has claimed; work begun
- `BLOCKED` — cannot proceed; reason in `Blocker:` field
- `IN-REVIEW` — PR open, CI running or human review pending
- `DONE` — merged to `main`; completion record filed
- `RETIRED` — task abandoned (rare; requires CEO sign-off)

---

## 6. TASK LIST

Each task uses this shape:

```
CNZ-WORK-001-<ID>: <name>
Wave: A–H
Priority: P0–P3
Scope: S | M | L | XL
Agent: copilot | claude-code | either

CEO_GATE: NO
FIZ: NO
Source: Implied by CEO 2026-04-21 source-of-truth declaration

Wave: A
Priority: P1
Scope: S
Agent: copilot
Depends-on: A001
CEO_GATE: NO

Status: DONE — 2026-04-23 — PR pending — CNZ-WORK-001-A009-DONE.md (10 remote branches enumerated and classified; no deletions performed)
Directive: From A001 branch list, produce a report classifying each branch as ACTIVE / STALE-CANDIDATE (no commits in 60+ days, no open PR) / CONFIRMED-MERGED. Report only — do not delete anything. CEO reviews; deletion is a separate authorized action.
```

Directive: Search the repo (all directories, all branches) for RRR_CEO_DECISIONS_FINAL_2026-04-17.md. If found, dump full contents to REPORT_BACK and cross-check against current canonical decisions. If not found, report not-present and CEO will decide whether to source from elsewhere or treat as never-landed.

CNZ-WORK-001-A011: Verify presence and contents of PROGRAM_CONTROL subdirectories
Wave: A
Priority: P1

CEO_GATE: NO
FIZ: NO

Status: DONE — 2026-04-23 — PR pending — CNZ-WORK-001-A011-DONE.md (both directories present with substantive content; no .gitkeep needed)
Directive: Confirm whether PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/DONE/ and PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/ exist. If absent, create them as empty directories with .gitkeep files. These paths are required by the charter completion-record protocol (§11).
```

```
CNZ-WORK-001-A012: Reconcile commit prefix enums
Wave: A
Priority: P1
Scope: S
Agent: claude-code
Depends-on: A001
CEO_GATE: YES
FIZ: NO
Source: Tech debt finding 2026-04-21
Status: DONE — 2026-04-23 — PR pending — CNZ-WORK-001-A012-DONE.md (CEO decisions landed 2026-04-23: hybrid enum model, domain prefixes preserved, HCZ split from HZ, net-new domain prefixes added; resolves prefix half of R-CLARIFY-006)
Directive: Two commit-prefix enums exist in repo history. Old OQMI v2.0 (root OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md): FIZ | NATS | OBS | HZ | BIJOU | CRM | INFRA | UI | GOV | CHORE. RRR-GOV-002 §3.5: FIZ | DB | API | SVC | INFRA | UI | GOV | TEST | CHORE. These differ. Author CNZ-canonical commit prefix enum and document in docs/DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md (or create the glossary if absent). Address R-CLARIFY-006 sub-question on HZ split (HZIO vs HCZ) at the same time. CEO_GATE because this is a naming-authority decision.

```
CNZ-WORK-001-A013: Move OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md path-reference reconciliation
Wave: A
Priority: P2
Scope: S
Agent: either
Depends-on: A001
CEO_GATE: NO
FIZ: NO
Source: Tech debt finding 2026-04-21
Status: DONE — 2026-04-23 — PR pending — CNZ-WORK-001-A013-DONE.md (directive premise partly incorrect — OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md does NOT contain "this repo, root" self-references in its Document header. The reference TO it lived in OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md header (fixed by A014) and §11 (fixed by this task A013). Other CNZ docs verified to reference correct PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/ paths.)
Directive: OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md self-references its own location as "this repo, root" in its Document header and §11 cross-references, but the file actually lives at PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/. Per CEO 2026-04-21 (these files all live together in DIRECTIVES/QUEUE), the file location is correct; the references inside the file need amendment. Update the self-references to match the actual path. Same pass: confirm all CNZ docs reference the correct path. Commit prefix GOV.

Directive: This task is CEO-action-only — agents cannot change repo visibility. Toggle repo Settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility to PRIVATE. Note in OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md §1 and §6 once complete.
```

```
CNZ-WORK-001-A099: WAVE A CLEANUP
Wave: A
Priority: P0
Scope: S
Agent: copilot
Depends-on: A001 through A013 (A014 is CEO-action and may run in parallel)
CEO_GATE: NO
FIZ: NO

Status: DONE — 2026-04-23 — PR pending — CNZ-WORK-001-A099-DONE.md (Wave A complete: A001-A014 all DONE; SoT consistency verified; §3/§7 of OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md updated to reflect all outcomes; §5 and §6 inspected — no Wave A items pending; lint coverage delegated to CI super-linter on PR; Wave A rollup REPORT_BACK filed; Wave B is now open)
Directive: Lint pass repo-wide. Dead-code sweep. Consistency check on the three SoT files in PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/. Confirm OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md §3, §5, §6, §7 reflect all Wave A outcomes. Roll up Wave A REPORT_BACKs into a single Wave A summary. Wave B does not open until this completes.
```

Scope: S
Agent: claude-in-chat
Depends-on: none
CEO_GATE: YES (CEO answers; agent only structures)
FIZ: NO
Source: Deficit doc Part 4
Status: QUEUED
Directive: Surface all twelve R-CLARIFY rows (R-CLARIFY-001 through R-CLARIFY-012) to CEO as a single consolidated question set, not one at a time. Format: question, options, downstream affected tasks. CEO answers in one pass. Answers feed Wave F task GAP_TYPE conversions.

FIZ: NO
Source: Deficit doc R-108, §5.3
Status: QUEUED
Directive: Once CEO has answered R-CLARIFY-012 (frontend repo location), decompose Black-Glass Interface scope into per-feature M/L tasks. Each feature becomes its own CNZ-WORK-001-G0NN row. Compliance gates UI, RBAC enforcement, kill switch UI, consent workflow UI, age gate UI, wallet integrity UI per Corpus Ch.6 are minimum decomposition units.
```

## 8. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE

This charter is amended, not replaced. To amend:

1. Open a PR modifying this file
1. Add new task(s) at the appropriate Wave with the next sequential ID
1. Or amend an existing task’s `Status:` line in-place
1. Update §7 cross-reference table if applicable
1. Update OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md §5 OUTSTANDING in the same PR

Auto-merge per OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §2.1 unless the amendment touches a §2.2 Human-Review Category (rare for this charter).

To retire this charter: CEO authors a successor (e.g. CNZ-WORK-002), explicitly marks this one RETIRED, and moves it to `archive/charters/CNZ-WORK-001.md`.

---

## 9. INVARIANT INHERITANCE

Every task in this charter inherits the invariants of OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md without restatement:

- §5.1 append-only, deterministic, idempotent
- §5.2 schema discipline (correlation_id, reason_code, no hardcoded constants)
- §5.3 Yarn-only package management
- §5.4 domain separation
- §5.5 no backdoors
- §6.1 secrets posture
- §6.2 network isolation
- §6.4 step-up authentication on sensitive actions
- §6.5 audit logging
- §7 advisory-AI boundary
- §8 commit discipline (FIZ four-line format on financial-integrity paths)
- §12 invariants quick-reference register

A task that would violate an invariant is invalid. An agent that detects a conflict HARD_STOPs and reports per OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §3.

---

## 10. REPORT_BACK PROTOCOL

Every task generates a REPORT_BACK at `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-<task-id>-report.md` on completion or block. Format:

```
# CNZ-WORK-001-<task-id> — <name>

**Status on completion:** DONE | BLOCKED | PARTIAL
**Agent:** <copilot | claude-code | claude-in-chat>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**PR:** #NNN (or "n/a")
**Merge commit SHA:** <sha> (or "n/a")

## What was done
<bullet list of concrete actions taken>

## What was found / surfaced
<any discoveries, anomalies, dependencies revealed>

## What's left
<if PARTIAL or BLOCKED, what remains and why>

## Files touched
<list>

## Tests added / modified
<list>

## OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md updates landed in same PR
- §3 DONE: <yes/no, what>
- §5 OUTSTANDING: <yes/no, what>
- §6 BLOCKERS: <yes/no, what>
```

---

## 11. DONE-RECORD TEMPLATE

When a task completes and merges, write `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/DONE/CNZ-WORK-001-<task-id>-DONE.md`:

```
# CNZ-WORK-001-<task-id> — DONE

**Task name:** <name>
**Wave:** <A–H>
**Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Agent:** <copilot | claude-code | claude-in-chat>
**PR:** #NNN
**Merge commit SHA:** <sha>
**REPORT_BACK:** <link to report file>

## Summary
<one-paragraph description of what was delivered>

## Files merged
<list>

## Follow-ups (if any)
<new tasks generated, deferred items, etc.>
```

Then amend the task’s `Status:` line in §6 of this charter from `QUEUED` (or `CLAIMED` / `IN-REVIEW`) to `DONE — <PR> — <DONE-record-filename>`.

---

## 12. END OF CHARTER

This is the active work charter for ChatNow.Zone. It is a list of tasks, not a governance document. Governance lives in OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md. State lives in OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md. Tasks live here.

**Authority:** Kevin B. Hartley, CEO — OmniQuest Media Inc.
**Charter ID:** CNZ-WORK-001
**Total tasks at open:** 14 (Wave A) + 3 (Wave B) + 8 (Wave C) + 8 (Wave D) + 3 (Wave E) + 9 (Wave F) + 2 (Wave G placeholders) + 7 (Wave H) + 8 cleanup = **62 tasks**, of which Wave G will expand significantly post-decomposition.
