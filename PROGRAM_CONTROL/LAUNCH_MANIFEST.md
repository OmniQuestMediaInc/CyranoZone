## 5. Cross-Cutting Reporting

Every owner files a report-back into `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/` using
`docs/DIRECTIVE_TEMPLATE.md`. Report-back filenames follow
`LAUNCH_<sequence-id>_<owner>_<yyyy-mm-dd>.md`.

## 6. CEO Final Gate

The hard-launch authorisation is filed in
`PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/LAUNCH_GATE_2026-10-01.md` and is the
single document that converts this manifest from "in flight" to
"executed". No agent — Claude Code, Copilot, or human — may flip the
production feature flags without that clearance.
