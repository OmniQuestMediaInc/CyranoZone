## TASK 1: Branch Disposition Report

The "previous turn" comprised PR #84 (`copilot/wo-052-5-repo-pruning`) and PR #85 (`copilot/audit-branches-and-sync-main`), both merged into `main` on 2026-03-15. Those PRs each committed only an "Initial plan" with no file changes and no explicit API branch deletions.

All branches below were merged into `main` via their respective Pull Requests and subsequently removed from the remote (GitHub auto-delete-on-merge). **No branches were deleted by explicit agent action in the previous turn.**
