# WO Report-Back: Verify PL/pgSQL $$ delimiter fix (PR #54)

## Branch + HEAD Commit

- **Branch:** `copilot/fix-syntax-error-in-sql`
- **HEAD:** `be1a9bc2d09e89e195c75e8ce44a584faac5e1a0`
- **PR:** #54

## Files Changed (`git diff --stat`)

```
(no source changes — diff against origin/main is empty)
```

The `$${` → `$$` syntax fix was delivered by **PR #40** and merged into `main` on
2026-03-08. This branch was created from that merged state. This report-back
confirms that all three affected PL/pgSQL functions already use correct delimiters
and no further changes are required.

## Verification

### 1. No invalid `$${` patterns remain

```
$ grep -n '\$\${' infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql
(no output — exit code 1, meaning no matches found)
```

### 2. All function body delimiters are correct `$$`

```
$ grep -n '\$\$' infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql
173:RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
181:$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
300:RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
328:$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
338:RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
345:$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

| Line | Function                          | Delimiter               | Status     |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| 173  | `ledger_entries_block_mutation()` | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$` | ✅ Correct |
| 300  | `transactions_block_mutation()`   | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$` | ✅ Correct |
| 338  | `set_transactions_updated_at()`   | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$` | ✅ Correct |

## Result

✅ SUCCESS — `infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql` contains no invalid `$${` delimiters.
All three trigger functions conform to Postgres PL/pgSQL dollar-quoting norms.
The `validate-schema` CI job passes. No code changes were required in this PR.
