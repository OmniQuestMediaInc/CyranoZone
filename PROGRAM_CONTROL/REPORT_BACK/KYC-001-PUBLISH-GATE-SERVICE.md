## Implementation Summary

### PublishGateService (R0 — highest risk class)

- **Rule ID:** `PUBLISH_GATE_v1`
- **MINIMUM_AGE_YEARS:** 18 (deterministic constant)
- **Gate logic (3 sequential blocks):**
  1. KYC status must be `VERIFIED` — blocks `PENDING`, `EXPIRED`, `REJECTED`
  2. KYC expiry date must not precede `recorded_at` timestamp
  3. Performer must be >= 18 years old at content `recorded_at` (not at publish time)
- **On block:** publishes SEV1 to `kyc.publish_gate.blocked` via NATS
- **On approval:** publishes to `kyc.publish_gate.approved` via NATS
- **Override boundary:** COMPLIANCE role + step-up (advisory, not enforced in this service)

### NATS Topics Added

```
PUBLISH_GATE_APPROVED: 'kyc.publish_gate.approved'
PUBLISH_GATE_BLOCKED:  'kyc.publish_gate.blocked'
```

## HANDOFF

- **Built:** PublishGateService with deterministic 18+ age gate, KYC status enforcement, SEV1 NATS events
- **Left incomplete:** No unit test file (directive did not request one); COMPLIANCE override flow not implemented (advisory boundary per directive)
- **Next agent's first task:** Execute MOD-001 (incident lifecycle state machine) — depends on KYC-001 being merged
