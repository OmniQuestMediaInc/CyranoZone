## A099 directive line-items

### Lint pass repo-wide

Delegated to CI on the PR. The repo carries `.github/workflows/super-linter.yml` which runs on PRs. Wave A modifications were:

- File deletions (`README.md`, root `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md`)
- File move (`Sovereign_Kernel.md.pdf` → `archive/governance/`)
- Markdown edits in DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md, OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md, OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md (QUEUE), CNZ-WORK-001.md, REPO_MANIFEST.md, copilot-instructions.md
- Required-files manifest update (`.github/required-files.txt`)
- 22 NEW markdown paperwork files (10 REPORT_BACK + 10 DONE + this Wave A rollup pair + the A012/A014 pair from PR #310 already merged is forthcoming)

No source code (TypeScript/JavaScript) was touched. Risk surface for code lint is zero. Markdown lint and structure-validate will run on PR open.

### Dead-code sweep

Not applicable in Wave A (no code touched). Dead-code sweep is meaningful in Wave D/E/F when services land. Deferred to per-Wave cleanup tasks (D099/E099/etc.).

### Consistency check on the three SoT files in PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/

Three SoT files inspected:

1. **`OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md`**: Truncated at §8 (defect flagged by A012). §8.1 cross-link to glossary added. Truncation note in §8 flags missing §§9–§12. **Recommend new task A015** to restore from authoritative source.
2. **`OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md`**: §1 populated; §3 has rows for all 14 Wave A tasks; §6 BLOCKERS shows no Wave A blockers; §7 RETIRED ITEMS updated with Wave A retirements; §8 PROVENANCE has all Wave A provenance notes; §9 last-review date current.
3. **`CNZ-WORK-001.md`**: All 14 Wave A task status lines amended to DONE with PR references and DONE-record filenames per charter §11 protocol. §6 task list intact. §7 cross-reference table unchanged (correct).

Consistency: ✅ all three files internally consistent and cross-consistent.

### Confirm OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md §3, §5, §6, §7 reflect all Wave A outcomes

- **§3 DONE**: 14 rows added (A001–A014 + A099). ✅
- **§5 OUTSTANDING**: Backlog is tracked inside CNZ-WORK-001.md charter, not duplicated in §5. Template-row examples in §5 are non-binding placeholders. ✅ (no change needed)
- **§6 BLOCKERS**: Inspected; no Wave A items pending. Template-row examples remain as placeholders. ✅
- **§7 RETIRED**: 5 new rows added covering root `package-lock.json`, root `CLAUDE.md`, root `README.md`, root `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` (v2.0 doctrine), root `Sovereign_Kernel.md.pdf` (as authoritative). ✅

### Roll up Wave A REPORT_BACKs into a single Wave A summary

This file IS the Wave A summary. Per-task REPORT_BACKs are at:

- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A001-report.md` (pre-charter; presumed already filed under A001's prior pass — not authored in this charter run)
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A002-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A003-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A004-report.md` (pre-charter; filed by Thread 19/A004)
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A005-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A006-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A007-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A008-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A009-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A010-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A011-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A012-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A013-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A014-report.md`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/CNZ-WORK-001-A099-WAVE-A-CLEANUP-report.md` (this file)

## Cross-cutting findings & recommended new tasks

1. **`OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` truncation** (flagged by A012, A013, this rollup). File ends at §8 mid-codeblock; §§9–§12 referenced elsewhere are missing. Mitigation in Wave A: §8 dangling fence closed, FIZ four-line format restored from glossary cross-reference, truncation note added. **Recommend new task `CNZ-WORK-001-A015`** — restore §§9–§12 from authoritative source. Scope: S, Agent: claude-code, CEO_GATE: NO if mechanical / YES if reconstruction required.
2. **Branch cleanup** (flagged by A009). 10 remote branches enumerated; 4 likely-merged candidates and 4 needing-inspection. **Recommend new task `CNZ-WORK-001-A016`** — CEO-authorized branch deletion pass. Scope: S, Agent: copilot, CEO_GATE: YES.
3. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md` doctrine refresh** (flagged by A005, A006). File carries large stretches of stale OQMI CODING DOCTRINE v2.0 content + superseded prefix list. Header pointer fixed in Wave A; full refresh is follow-up. **Recommend new task `CNZ-WORK-001-A017`** — doctrine refresh of copilot-instructions.md. Scope: M, Agent: claude-code, CEO_GATE: NO.
4. **R-CLARIFY-009 strong signal** (flagged by A010). RRR_CEO_DECISIONS_FINAL_2026-04-17.md content + D5 GGS deferral pattern strongly suggests RedRoomRewards is intended as a separate repo. Wave B B001 should incorporate this pre-signal.
5. **Wave A REPORT_BACK protocol opportunity:** the per-task REPORT_BACKs use the §10 verbose template. For pure paperwork tasks (A002, A007, A011) the template is overkill. **Optional doctrine refinement:** add a "minimal" REPORT_BACK template for verification-only tasks. Not blocking.

## OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md updates landed in same PR

- §1 REPO ORIENTATION: yes (in A014 pass; this rollup confirms it stays current)
- §3 DONE: yes — 11 rows added across this PR (A002, A003, A005, A006, A007, A008, A009, A010, A011, A013, A099); A012 and A014 already in PR #310
- §5 OUTSTANDING: no change (charter is the backlog SoT)
- §6 BLOCKERS: no Wave A items pending
- §7 RETIRED ITEMS: 5 new rows added
- §8 PROVENANCE: 5 new provenance notes added across this PR (Sovereign_Kernel archive, root SYSTEM_STATE deletion, README deletion, copilot-instructions doctrine staleness, plus A012-era prior notes)
- §9: Last full review = 2026-04-23

## Wave B opens

Per charter §3 cadence: "The next Wave does not open until the cleanup task is DONE." A099 is now DONE.

**Wave B (CEO Decision Surfacing)** is unblocked. First task: **B001 — Consolidate R-CLARIFY surface to CEO** (12 R-CLARIFY questions presented as a single decision pass, minus R-CLARIFY-006 which is now resolved). Wave B is recommended for a fresh session per the user's session-management protocol — this charter run has consumed substantial context and Wave B begins substantive product/architecture decisions that benefit from a clean slate.
