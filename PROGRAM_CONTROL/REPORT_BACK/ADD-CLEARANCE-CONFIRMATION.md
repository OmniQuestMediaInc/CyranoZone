# ADD-CLEARANCE-CONFIRMATION — Report-Back

**Task:** Build the mechanism for recording GOV-FINTRAC and GOV-AGCO
clearance confirmations so DFSP-001 (and downstream gated directives)
can be unblocked by a CEO + retained-counsel signature rather than by
an agent-emitted string.

**Repo:** `OmniQuestMediaInc/ChatNowZone--BUILD`
**Branch:** `claude/add-clearance-confirmation-QcyBv`
**HEAD:** `8316e039907ad3226d7b12d368c2f15f54e1adc4`
**Base:** `e64cce3` (main)
**Commit prefix:** `GOV:` (standard format — not FIZ-scoped, no
`finance/`, `governance/`, or ledger/balance paths touched)

---

## Why this work was necessary

The branch request came in as: "confirm `GOV-FINTRAC cleared` and
`GOV-AGCO cleared` — that unlocks DFSP-001." That confirmation cannot
come from an AI agent — it is a compliance attestation that qualified
legal counsel has issued a written opinion under PCMLTFA and AGCO
rules. `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/DFSP-001.md` already
explicitly states:

> Claude Code must fill actual clearance confirmation in GATE line
> before committing. Do not fabricate gate clearance.

The correct action is therefore **not** to emit the string, but to
build the mechanism that records a real human's clearance when it
arrives — making the gate verifiable against a signed artifact, not
against agent output.

## What was built

| Path                                     | Kind            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/README.md`   | new             | Signing contract. Authorized signers = CEO or retained legal counsel only. Explicit prohibition against AI agents authoring, modifying, or simulating clearance records.                                                                                                                                    |
| `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/TEMPLATE.md` | new             | YAML-front-matter template for a clearance record. Safe by default: `status: NOT_CLEARED`, `ceo_acknowledgment: NOT_SIGNED`. Carries `opinion_document_sha256`, `drive_intel_reference`, `correlation_id`, `reason_code`, `blocking_release`, `signed_by`, `signed_at` (America/Toronto), and `supersedes`. |
| `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/.gitkeep`    | new             | Directory marker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `scripts/verify-gov-gate.sh`             | new, executable | Read-only verifier. `./scripts/verify-gov-gate.sh GOV-FINTRAC` exits `0` iff a clearance record exists with `gate_id` matching the query, `status: CLEARED`, and `ceo_acknowledgment: SIGNED`. Otherwise exits `1`. Exits `2` on usage error.                                                               |
| `PROGRAM_CONTROL/GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md`    | modified        | Added an "Evidentiary records (machine-verifiable)" section linking to the verifier and the signing contract. **No gate checkboxes modified.** Both GOV-FINTRAC and GOV-AGCO remain awaiting counsel.                                                                                                       |

## Verifier test matrix

All five cases executed against the verifier before commit. A
throwaway fixture `GOV-TESTGATE-2099-12-31.md` was created in
`PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/` for the tests, mutated in place across
cases 3–5, and **deleted before staging**. `git status` and `ls
PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/` were checked post-delete to confirm no
fixture artifact remained.

## Gate status after this commit (unchanged)

- **GOV-FINTRAC:** ⏳ Awaiting counsel retention + written opinion.
- **GOV-AGCO:** ⏳ Awaiting documentation + counsel review.
- **DFSP-001:** QUEUED — remains blocked. No `CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED`
  exception exists for DFSP-001.
- **PROC-001:** ✅ Cleared at `0aa416c` (verifiable against
  `git log`), under `CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED-2026-04-10` — unaffected.

This commit installs the mechanism only. Kevin B. Hartley, CEO, or
retained counsel must author the actual clearance record files when
opinions are in hand.

list. Only invariants that can apply to this change are listed; the
rest are `NOT_APPLICABLE` with reason.

**Append-only:** ✅ Clearance records are declared append-only in the
README; corrections use a later-dated file with a `supersedes`
reference, never an in-place edit.

**Deterministic & idempotent:** ✅ Verifier is a pure read of the
latest clearance file for the given gate id; repeated runs over an
unchanged working tree produce identical output and exit code.

---

## Open gaps / follow-ups

1. **`.github/CODEOWNERS` entry.** Add
   `/PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/ @<ceo-github-handle>` to
   `.github/CODEOWNERS` (create the file if absent). Intentionally
   left for the CEO because it requires a human GitHub handle that
   an agent must not guess.
2. **No actual clearance records exist.** `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/`
   contains only `README.md`, `TEMPLATE.md`, and `.gitkeep`. The real
   records must be authored by the CEO or retained counsel when
   opinions are in hand.
3. **Tracker checkboxes unchanged.** When the first real clearance
   record is committed, also tick the matching checkboxes in
   `PROGRAM_CONTROL/GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md` so the human-readable and
   machine-verifiable views stay in lockstep.

---

## Result

**SUCCESS** — mechanism built, verifier tested against a 5-case
matrix (all expected exit codes observed), test fixture deleted
before commit, committed at `8316e03` on
`claude/add-clearance-confirmation-QcyBv`. DFSP-001 remains
correctly blocked on GOV-FINTRAC and GOV-AGCO; no clearance
fabricated.

## HANDOFF

**Built:** Clearance record mechanism: directory, README (signing
contract + agent prohibition), template (safe defaults), verifier
script (tested), tracker cross-reference, this report-back.

**Left incomplete:**

- No real clearance records exist in `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/` —
  those must be authored by the CEO or retained counsel.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` not created.

**Next agent's first task:**

- If executing DFSP-001 or any directive naming GOV-FINTRAC or
  GOV-AGCO in its `GATE:` line, run
  `./scripts/verify-gov-gate.sh GOV-FINTRAC` and
  `./scripts/verify-gov-gate.sh GOV-AGCO` before any commit. If
  either fails, HARD_STOP and report that the gates are not yet
  cleared.
- Do not author files in `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/`. See the
  README in that directory.
