# WO Report-Back: Fix invalid PL/pgSQL delimiter in ledger_entries_block_mutation function

## Branch + HEAD Commit

- **Branch:** `copilot/fix-invalid-delimiter-in-functions`
- **HEAD:** `aec81ef95d05b5ca7fe74d38d4a363a0ce3f25b0`

## Files Changed (`git diff --stat`)

This work order is an **audit and verification** of the fix delivered by PR #40.
No additional source changes were required in this branch — the delimiter fix was
already present in `main` and is confirmed correct here.

```

## Root Cause

`infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql` previously contained `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $${` in
three PL/pgSQL function definitions. Postgres interprets `$${` as the opening of a
custom dollar-quote tag (requiring a matching `$${` closing delimiter), not as the
anonymous `$$` dollar-quote. This produced the CI failure logged in the referenced job:

```
psql:infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql:180: ERROR:  syntax error at or near "{"
LINE 2: RETURNS TRIGGER AS $${
```

The root fix was delivered by PR #40 (`copilot/fix-syntax-error-in-sql`), merged 2026-03-08.
This audit confirms that all three affected functions now use the correct `$$` delimiter.

## Audit of ALL CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Statements

| Line | Function                          | Opening delimiter                  | Closing delimiter                 | Status     |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 172  | `ledger_entries_block_mutation()` | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$` (line 173) | `$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;` (line 181) | ✅ Correct |
| 299  | `transactions_block_mutation()`   | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$` (line 300) | `$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;` (line 328) | ✅ Correct |
| 337  | `set_transactions_updated_at()`   | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$` (line 338) | `$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;` (line 345) | ✅ Correct |

No `$${` or `$${{` patterns remain anywhere in the file.

## Commands Run + Verbatim Outputs

### 1. Verify no `$${` pattern remains

```
$ grep -n '\$\${' infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql
(no output — exit code 1, meaning no matches found)
```

### 2. Confirm all CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delimiters

```
$ grep -n '\$\$' infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql
173:RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
181:$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
300:RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
328:$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
338:RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
345:$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

All three function bodies open and close with `$$` — conforming to Postgres dollar-quoting norms.

### 3. CI validate-schema reference

- Run ID `22819607617` on branch `main` concluded: `success`
- The `validate-schema` job (psql apply on postgres:16) passed after PR #40 was merged.

## Result

✅ SUCCESS — All PL/pgSQL dollar-quote delimiters in `infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql`
conform to Postgres norms. The `validate-schema` CI step passes. No further changes required.
