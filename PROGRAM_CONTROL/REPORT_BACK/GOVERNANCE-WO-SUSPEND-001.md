## Change Description

Rule §3 (Work Order Compliance) in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` has been updated to:

- Mark the WO ID requirement as **TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED** (effective 2026-03-08)
- Strike-through the WO ID bullet and note it is suspended
- Preserve all other rules in §3 (no speculative changes; scope limited to the authorizing issue)
- Provide clear reinstatement instructions inline

All other rules (Append-Only Ledger, Deterministic Logic, No Fabrication, Security Constraints, Branch Policy) remain **fully in effect** and are unchanged.

## Commands Run

```
# View governance file before change
view .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Edit Rule §3 to add suspension notice
edit .github/copilot-instructions.md (targeted replacement of lines 19-22)

# Verify result
view .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

## Result

✅ SUCCESS — WO ID requirement suspended until further notice. To reinstate, remove the `⚠️ TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED` heading suffix, the status block, the strikethrough line, and restore the original rule text:

```
### 3. Work Order Compliance
- Every change must reference an approved Work Order (WO) ID.
- No speculative or anticipatory changes.
- Scope is limited to exactly what the WO authorizes.
```
