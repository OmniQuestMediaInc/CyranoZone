## Commands Run & Verbatim Outputs

### 1. Identified failing CI evidence

- Run: 22818823544, Job: 66188229190
- Error: `psql:infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql:180: ERROR: syntax error at or near "{"`
- Cause: three PL/pgSQL function definitions used `$${` instead of `$$` as the dollar-quote delimiter.

### 2. Grep for all `$${` occurrences (before fix)

```
infra/postgres/init-ledger.sql: 3 matches (lines 173, 299, 337)
```

### 3. Edits applied

| Line 179 (same function)                   | Added `RETURN NULL;` after `RAISE EXCEPTION` (unreachable but required by PL/pgSQL) |
| Line 299 `transactions_block_mutation()`   | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $${` → `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$`                                  |
| Line 337 `set_transactions_updated_at()`   | `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $${` → `RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$`                                  |
