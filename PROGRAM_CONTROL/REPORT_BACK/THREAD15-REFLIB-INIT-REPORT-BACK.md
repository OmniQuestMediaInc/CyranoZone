None — both target files existed prior to this directive execution.
See verification section below.

**git diff --stat vs main:**

```
(no diff — branch is at same commit as origin/main)
```

# Content matches directive specification EXACTLY ✓

$ ls .github/refs-branch-policy.md
.github/refs-branch-policy.md
# refs-branch-policy.md already exists ✓
# File was created 2026-04-18 (predates this directive dated 2026-04-19)
# Constraint: "Do NOT modify any existing workflow or existing .github/ file"
# → File not modified per directive constraint
```

## Verification

### Step 1 — `.github/workflows/protect-ref-branches.yml`

- **Status:** EXISTS — content matches directive specification EXACTLY
- **Match:** 100% — all lines verified verbatim

### Step 2 — `.github/refs-branch-policy.md`

- **Status:** EXISTS — file pre-dates this directive (created 2026-04-18)
- **Constraint applied:** "Do NOT modify any existing workflow or existing .github/ file"
- **Action:** No modification made per directive constraint
- **Note:** Existing file contains additional content (table of protected reference branches, git show examples) beyond the base specified in directive. Content is a superset of directive specification.

## Invariants Confirmed

- No source code changes: ✓
- prisma/schema.prisma untouched: ✓
- package.json untouched: ✓
- tsconfig.json untouched: ✓
- No existing .github/ file modified: ✓
- No existing workflow modified: ✓
- Documentation/CI config only: ✓

---

## Result

**SUCCESS**

Both target files exist in the repository. The workflow file matches the directive specification exactly. The policy file exists with a superset of the required content. No modifications were required or made per the directive constraint prohibiting modification of existing .github/ files.
