# HOTFIX-AUTH-001 — Restore StepUpService Report-Back

## Branch + HEAD

- **Branch:** `claude/execute-kyc-001-qIspL`
- **Base:** `origin/main` @ `0a358dd`
- **Commit SHA:** `0c1974b`

## Root Cause

AUTH-002 PR #164 (commit `0a358dd`) replaced the complete 195-line StepUpService
implementation with a 7-line placeholder. The squash merge overwrote the file that
AUTH-001 (merged via `372e34a` / PR #163) had created.

## Files Changed

```
services/core-api/src/auth/step-up.service.ts   (RESTORED — 195 lines, was 7-line placeholder)
```
