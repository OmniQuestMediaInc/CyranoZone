## COMMIT 4 of 4 — HARD_STOP

**Result: HARD_STOP — Commit 4 cannot be executed by AI agent.**

## Blockers

### Blocker 1 — CLEARANCES file prohibited

**File requested:** `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED-2026-04-11.md`

`PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/README.md` contains an explicit absolute prohibition:

> **Prohibited:** AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and any future agent)
> MUST NOT author, modify, simulate, or suggest content for any file in this directory.
> An agent-authored clearance record is invalid by construction and must be reverted.

This prohibition applies regardless of instruction source. Creating this file would produce
an invalid clearance record by construction. Agent refused per doctrine.

**Action required:** Kevin B. Hartley (CEO) or retained counsel must author and commit
`PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED-2026-04-11.md` directly.

---

### Blocker 2 — GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md source is Google Drive

**File requested:** Replace `PROGRAM_CONTROL/GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md` from Drive ID `1jRpmf5x3k4nipi2Le7Z-mxi54Gpp_bJO`

The agent does not have access to Google Drive. The replacement content cannot be retrieved.

**Action required:** CEO to pull file from Drive and commit directly.

---

### Blocker 3 — verify-gov-gate.sh validation tests cannot pass without clearance files

Even if `scripts/verify-gov-gate.sh` is updated to accept `CEO_AUTHORIZED_STAGED` as a valid
status, the validation tests require:

- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/GOV-FINTRAC-*.md` with `status: CEO_AUTHORIZED_STAGED`
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/GOV-AGCO-*.md` with `status: CEO_AUTHORIZED_STAGED`

Both files fall under Blocker 1 above. The script update alone does not enable the tests to pass.

---

## What was NOT done (Commit 4)

- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/CLEARANCES/CEO-AUTHORIZED-STAGED-2026-04-11.md` — NOT created
- `PROGRAM_CONTROL/GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md` — NOT replaced
- `scripts/verify-gov-gate.sh` — NOT modified (update is contingent on clearance files existing)
