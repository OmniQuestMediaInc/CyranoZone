# REPORT-BACK: GM-002 — Games Module Wiring

**Directive:** GM-002
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Commit prefix:** BIJOU:
**Date:** 2026-03-29

## What Was Built

### Task 1: `services/core-api/src/games/games.module.ts` (CREATED)

- NestJS module registering `GamesController`, `GameEngineService`, and `GovernanceConfigService`
- Exports `GameEngineService` for downstream consumption

### Task 2: `services/core-api/src/games/games.controller.ts` (CREATED)

- `POST /games/play` endpoint enforcing debit-before-reveal invariant
- Guard rejects requests missing `ledger_entry_id` with `DEBIT_REQUIRED` error
- Orchestration: `initiatePlay()` → validate → `resolveOutcome()` → return
- Interfaces: `InitiatePlayRequest`, `PlayResponse`

### Task 3: `services/core-api/src/app.module.ts` (MODIFIED)

- Added `GamesModule` import and registered in `@Module({ imports })` array

## Validation

- [x] `games.module.ts` exists and exports `GameEngineService`
- [x] `games.controller.ts` exists with `POST /games/play` endpoint
- [x] Controller throws `DEBIT_REQUIRED` error when `ledger_entry_id` is absent
- [x] `GamesModule` appears in `app.module.ts` imports array
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (pre-existing module resolution errors from missing node_modules are unrelated)

## What Was Left Incomplete

- Full `LedgerService` debit verification (deferred to GM-003 per directive)
- Independent database verification of `ledger_entry_id` (deferred to GM-003)

## HANDOFF

Next agent's first task: Execute GM-003 to wire LedgerService integration so the controller can independently verify `ledger_entry_id` against the database before resolving outcomes.
