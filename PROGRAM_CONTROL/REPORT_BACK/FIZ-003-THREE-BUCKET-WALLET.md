# REPORT BACK — FIZ-003-THREE-BUCKET-WALLET

## Task

Add Three-Bucket Wallet routing layer to LedgerService. ADDITIVE only — no changes to existing methods.

## Repo

OmniQuestMediaInc/ChatNowZone--BUILD

## Branch

main

## HEAD

0d08900

## Files Changed

```
 services/core-api/src/finance/ledger.service.ts | 110 +++++++++++++++++++++++-
 1 file changed, 109 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

## Changes Made (all additive)

### TokenType enum

- Added `BIJOU = 'BIJOU'` after `SHOW_THEATER`

### New exports appended

- `WalletBucket` enum: PROMOTIONAL_BONUS (priority 1), MEMBERSHIP_ALLOCATION (priority 2), PURCHASED (priority 3)
- `BucketBalance` interface: bucket, balance (bigint), spendPriority (1 | 2 | 3)

### New methods appended to LedgerService

- `debitWallet()` — deterministic spend-order debit across three buckets, each debit a separate append-only ledger entry
- `getBucketBalance()` — derives balance for a specific bucket from ledger metadata
- `getAllBucketBalances()` — returns all three bucket balances in spend-priority order

## Validation

### Existing methods unchanged

```
recordEntry()          — signature and body identical to prior HEAD (lines 34-83)
handleDisputeReversal() — signature and body identical to prior HEAD (lines 90-127)
getBalance()           — signature and body identical to prior HEAD (lines 132-152)
```

PASS — diff shows only additions (109 insertions, 1 deletion for trailing comma on SHOW_THEATER)

### npx tsc --noEmit

No tsconfig.json in repo; NestJS/typeorm deps not installed. Only errors are missing module declarations — no code-level TypeScript errors. Consistent with FIZ-002 baseline.

### debitWallet callable

New method calls existing `recordEntry()` and new `getBucketBalance()` — no breaking changes to existing callers.

## Result

SUCCESS
