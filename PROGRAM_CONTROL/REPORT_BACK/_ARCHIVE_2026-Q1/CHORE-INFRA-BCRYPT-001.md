## Installed Versions

### bcrypt

- **Package.json range:** `^5.1.1`
- **Resolved version:** `5.1.1`
- **Registry:** https://registry.yarnpkg.com/bcrypt/-/bcrypt-5.1.1.tgz
- **Integrity:** sha512-AGBHOG5hPYZ5Xl9KXzU5iKq9516yEmvCKDg3ecP5kX2aB6UqTeXZxk2ELnDgDm6BQSMlLt9rDB4LoSMx0rYwww==

### @types/bcrypt

- **Package.json range:** `^5.0.2`
- **Resolved version:** `5.0.2`
- **Registry:** https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@types/bcrypt/-/bcrypt-5.0.2.tgz
- **Integrity:** sha512-6atioO8Y75fNcbmj0G7UjI9lXN2pQ/IGJ2FWT4a/btd0Lk9lQalHLKhkgKVZ3r+spnmWUKfbMi1GEe9wyHQfNQ==

## Application Source Verification

Verified that NO application source files import `bcrypt` (as required — DFSP-001 will add imports):

```bash
find services -name "*.ts" -type f -exec grep -l "import.*bcrypt" {} \; 2>/dev/null
(no results)
```

## Commit

**Hash:** 739df58
**Message:**

```
chore(infra): add bcrypt + @types/bcrypt to unblock DFSP-001 Module 3 Invariant #13 carve-out
```

**Format:** CHORE scope — single-line commit (no FIZ four-line required per Program Control discipline)

---

## DFSP-001 Unblocked

✅ `bcrypt` present in `package.json` dependencies
✅ `@types/bcrypt` present in `package.json` devDependencies
✅ `yarn.lock` regenerated and committed
✅ No application source modified
✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (exit code 0)
✅ Report-back filed

**DFSP-001 is now dispatchable** — Claude Chat may re-issue the DFSP-001 dispatch prompt for a fresh DROID session. STEP 2 preconditions will now pass.

---

## Notes

- bcrypt warnings about deprecated transitive dependencies (@mapbox/node-pre-gyp chain) are expected and do not affect functionality
- The canonical `bcrypt` package (native, node-gyp) is the NestJS convention and matches the DFSP-001 Module 3 `bcrypt.compare()` API expectation
- No security vulnerabilities introduced (bcrypt 5.1.1 is current as of this report)
