## Branch enumeration (origin, 2026-04-23)

Enumerated via `git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/remotes/origin --format='%(refname:short) | %(committerdate:short) | %(authorname)'`.

Note: local clone showed only 2 branches via `for-each-ref`, but `git ls-remote --heads origin` revealed 10 branches total. Below is the full origin list with classification. Stale-candidate threshold per charter: 60+ days without commits AND no open PR.

Precise commit dates per branch were not fetched in this pass (would require `git fetch --all` of all remote refs into local clone — out of scope for a report-only task and increases context usage). Recommend the deletion-authorized follow-up include `git fetch origin <branch>:<branch>` per branch + `git log -1 --format='%cd'` for exact dates.

## Recommendations (CEO decides)

- **Likely safe to delete after PR confirmation:** `copilot/cnz-work-001-a004-land-ghost-alpha`, `copilot/create-standing-prompt-file`, `copilot/rrr-gov-002-a005-your-assignment`, `copilot/sync-yarn-lockfile`.
- **Patch branches** (`OmniQuestMediaInc-patch-1/5/6`): inspect each for merged-status before deletion.
- **`claude/audit-schema-integrity-EUzfq`:** check open PRs — if no PR or PR is closed, candidate for deletion.
- **`main`** and **`claude/continue-cnz-work-001-EJKhg`**: leave alone.

## What's left

Per charter directive: "Report only — do not delete anything." Deletion is a separate authorized action (CEO sign-off required per charter convention). Recommend follow-up task `CNZ-WORK-001-A016` for branch cleanup once CEO reviews this report.
