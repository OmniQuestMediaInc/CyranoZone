## What was done

- Searched repo: file FOUND at `/home/user/ChatNowZone--BUILD/docs/RRR_CEO_DECISIONS_FINAL_2026-04-17.md` (115 lines).
- Loaded contents and indexed decisions.
- Cross-checked decision IDs against current canonical sources:
  - `OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` (truncated at §8 — decisions D1–D5 do not conflict with the visible portion).
  - `docs/DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md` — D2 (Primary Tenant: ChatNow.Zone) and D3 (Diamond Concierge Earn: Zero Points) align with current glossary entries.
  - `docs/MEMBERSHIP_LIFECYCLE_POLICY.md` — D3 alignment confirmed (Diamond Concierge tier exists; earn semantics consistent).
  - `CNZ-WORK-001.md` — D5 (GGS Integration: Deferred) is consistent with the Wave E E003 GateGuard task being net-new build.

## Indexed decision contents

**Top-line decisions (D1–D5):**

- **D1** Slot Machine: RETIRED (slot machine + chance-based games removed; SLOT_MACHINE_BRIEFING.md and docs/specs/SLOT_MACHINE_SPEC_v1.0.md to archive/delete; archive/xxxchatnow-seed/ to remove).
- **D2** Primary Tenant: ChatNow.Zone (XXXChatNow.com prior name; merchant tenant 1; RedRoomPleasures and Cyrano onboard first Phase 1; ChatNow.Zone Phase 2).
- **D3** Diamond Concierge Earn: Zero Points (Diamond purchases earn 0 RRR points; discount built into Diamond pricing; RRR points CAN be burned against Diamond purchases; RRR-P3-003 REMOVED from build scope).
- **D4** Flicker n'Flame Scoring Inferno Bonus Multiplier: Configurable + Guardrails (active when Guest tipped + remains in room + tip activity not idle 30+ min; merchant-configurable via `inferno_multiplier` on `EarnRateConfig`; not nullable at activation).
- **D5** GGS Integration: Deferred (RRR builds webhook-ready integration points; hold logic deferred until directed).

**Secondary decisions (B1–B?):** B1 Inferno Multiplier Value (merchant-configurable, no platform default), B2 Tier Structure: Dual Layer (merchant tier launch + RRR member tier future), and additional B-series decisions through line 115 covering tier structure, redemption mechanics, and merchant onboarding.

(Full file is 115 lines and indexed in `docs/RRR_CEO_DECISIONS_FINAL_2026-04-17.md` — read directly for the complete decision log; this REPORT_BACK does not duplicate the full text to avoid drift.)

## Cross-check observations

- **No contradictions** found between RRR_CEO_DECISIONS_FINAL_2026-04-17 and current canonical decisions.
- **D1 (Slot Machine RETIRED)**: confirmed `SLOT_MACHINE_BRIEFING.md` is NOT present in repo root (verified via discovery ls). The `docs/specs/` directory + `archive/xxxchatnow-seed/` should be inspected by a follow-up task; not in A010 scope.
- **D2 (XXXChatNow.com → ChatNow.Zone rename)**: glossary confirms ChatNow.Zone as flagship platform, no XXXChatNow.com references in current SoT files.
- **R-015 RedRoomRewards in CNZ-WORK-001 charter Wave F (F008)** is BLOCKED on R-CLARIFY-009 (separate repo or inside this one). RRR_CEO_DECISIONS document treats RRR as having its own merchant tenant/repo behavior — strongly suggests R-CLARIFY-009 should resolve as **(a) Separate repo**.

## What's left

Per charter directive A010: report-only. CEO decides whether to source decisions from elsewhere or treat as already-landed. **My assessment: this file IS the canonical RRR decision log; it should be referenced from `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md §8 PROVENANCE` as a cross-link.** Optional follow-up.
