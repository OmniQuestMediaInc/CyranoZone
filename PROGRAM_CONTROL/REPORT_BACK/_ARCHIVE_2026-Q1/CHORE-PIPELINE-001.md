## QUEUE Directive Routing Fields — Confirmation

**QUEUE scan result:** QUEUE contained only `.gitkeep` at execution time.
`PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/DFSP-001.md` — NOT PRESENT (already moved to DONE prior to this directive executing; skipped per directive instruction).

No other QUEUE directives required routing field additions.

---

## Issue Template Update — Confirmation

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/directive.yml` now contains the following routing fields (inserted before the existing `directive` textarea):

- `id: agent` — input, required, label: Agent
- `id: parallel_safe` — input, required, label: Parallel-safe
- `id: touches` — textarea, required, label: Touches (file paths)

---

## Directive Template — Confirmation

`docs/DIRECTIVE_TEMPLATE.md` created at repo root `/docs/DIRECTIVE_TEMPLATE.md`.
Contains all required sections: header block, Objective, Scope, Implementation Requirements, Invariant Checklist, Commit Format, Report-Back Requirements, Definition of Done.

---

## Result

**SUCCESS** — All Definition of Done items satisfied.
