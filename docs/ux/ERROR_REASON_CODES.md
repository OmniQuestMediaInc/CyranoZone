# Error code + reason_code catalog — wireframe binding

Companion to `docs/UX_INTEGRATION_BRIEF.md` §4. Two columns of
vocabulary, two audiences.

- **`reason_code`** — operator/audit-facing. Rides on every ledger
  entry, audit event, and gate decision. Surfaces in audit log rows,
  ops dashboards, support tickets. Wireframes treat reason codes as
  small chips next to events.
- **`error_code`** — end-user-facing. Surfaces in toasts, banners,
  modal overlays. Wireframes treat error codes via the recommended
  copy slot below.

The two vocabularies overlap (same string can appear as both) but the
audience and component family differ. Keep separate.

## End-user error codes (every code = a copy slot)

Wireframes show the copy in the slot, not the raw code. Code stays
visible only in a "show details" expander for support routing.

## Operator/audit reason codes (every code rides on a ledger row)

Wireframes display the raw `reason_code` as a chip on audit-log rows,
ledger detail screens, support-case detail screens. Tooltip on hover
shows the human description.

| `reason_code`                                                                         | Where written                                   | Operator-facing description                   |

## Surfacing rules

1. Audit-log rows always show `reason_code` + `correlation_id` + `actor_id`
   - timestamp.
2. End-user errors always show `error_code` resolved to the copy slot;
   the raw code is only in a collapsed "details" expander.
3. Both surfaces always include `correlation_id` for support routing —
   end-user surface in the details expander; operator surface inline.
4. No surface ever exposes `payload_hash` / `hash_prior` / `hash_current`
   to end users — those are operator-only on the audit chain viewer.
